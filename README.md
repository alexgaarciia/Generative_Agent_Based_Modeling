# ConcordiaSims
This project aims to make agentic AI equally accessible to users and researchers, particularly those without advanced technological expertise, enabling them to gain deeper insights into its interactions and decision-making processes.
<!--The main goal of this repository is to carry out simulations using generative agent-based models (GABMs). These are computer simulations used to study interactions between people, things, places and time. The main characteristic is that these are constructed using LLMs so that they act reasonably.-->

## Framework
To accomplish this, a framework was developed using Streamlit, enabling users to design, simulate, and analyze interactions between generative agents. The simulations are powered by a library specialized in agent modeling ([Concordia](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia)), while machine learning techniques are used to compare and group agents based on their psychological traits and goals.

<!--In order to carry out these simulations we will be using [Concordia](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia), a library for generative social simulation. It makes it easy to create and use models where agents act on their own. You can define environments with a special agent called the Game Master (GM), who manages the world where player agents interact. The agents say what they want to do in simple language, and the GM turns their words into actions.-->

<!--Traditionally, *Concordia requires access to a standard LLM API* to function effectively. However, instead of relying on a remote API, we will be using LM Studio to host a Local Inference Server. This server mimics OpenAI API endpoints, allowing us to run the LLM locally on our own hardware. -->
