## Agents
Normally, agents are made up of these elements:
1. Associative memory: Saves all observations, and does retrieval of semantically relevant memories on request.
2. Formative memory: Allows customization of traits, specific memories, and even details like the agent's birthday.
3. Component: Represents a part of the agent's thought process. Retrieves items from associative memory and formats or summarizes them in a way that makes them useful as context, either for another component or for action selection.
